Build Disease Co-morbidity Network Based on Observed-to-expected ratio (OER) Measure
}
\description{
This is a filtering function that removes insignificant co-morbidity links/edges from the raw co-morbidity network generated from individual disease progression data. Links/edges  with significant Observed-to-expected ratio (OER) greater than 1 are kept as the resulting network. The default significance level is 0.05.
